Python Circle API

This Python package, pythoncircleapi, provides functions to calculate the area of a square and a circle. Additionally, it includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of these functions.

#Installation
To use this package, you can install it via pip:
pip install pythoncircleapi

#Usage:
from pythoncircleapi.square import calculate_square_area
from pythoncircleapi.circle import calculate_circle_area

# Calculate the area of a square with side length 4
square_area = calculate_square_area(4)
print(f"Square Area: {square_area}")

# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 3
circle_area = calculate_circle_area(3)
print(f"Circle Area: {circle_area}")

#Unit Tests
Unit tests are provided in test_pythoncircleapi.py to validate the correctness of the area calculation functions. Run the tests using:
python test_pythoncircleapi.py
